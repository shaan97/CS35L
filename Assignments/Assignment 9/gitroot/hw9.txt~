I begin by switching to a branch with version 3. We will
call it quote

git checkout v3.0 -b quote

I then apply the patch we generated in the lab:

patch -p1 < ./quote-3.0-patch.txt


Now after studying how to use the Emacs function, I change
the long entry to file ChangeLog. There were six files
in total that needed to be changed.

emacs
C-x 4 a

For each file I said
The character '`' is kept in the comments.

I commited the changes to this branch quote by staging
them all quickly using

git add .

and then committing with

git commit -F ChangeLog

I could then generate the file formatted-patch.txt

git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt


I then exchanged the formatted-patch.txt with a partner,
and checked out version 3.0 again in a temporary branch
called partner

git checkout -f v3.0
git checkout -b partner

Then I just applied my partner's patch:

git am < ../formatted-patch.txt

I then just made sure everything worked using the same
method used in the lab:

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

And I verified tha tthe ChangeLog entry was indeed
there using:

make distdir

and going to the directory diffutils-3.0.1
