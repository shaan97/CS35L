At the top right there is a commit date and varying times for the
people who made the commits to this repository. The left column
provides email address and names of the software engineers that
performed the edits. The top left window has a graphic based list
that shows the commit history with different branches and merges.
The top tab thus is really the log of commits in a graphical form.

The main subwindow has a commit message; it contains info about
previous versions, new versions, different branches. The patch/tree
options in the right window can be used to view the current
rree structure and different files altered due to the commit.
